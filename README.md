>The StudentAccess app was created by students in the Coding and App Development class in 2015. 
It provides students with a multitude of services such as: checking grades, missing assignments, events, personal balance, staff contact information, and much more. 
Additionally it also allows students customization within the app with different theme preferences, and two different languages. 
All this is accomplished while maintaining a stylish and aesthetically pleasing appearance with the Ionic framework and Ionic Material.
